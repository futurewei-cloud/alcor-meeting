### Meeting Notes

1. German and Liguang introduced research topics from both teams
2. German will share the information about “Review of control plane simulation and verification technologies” (please find attached file)
3. Apoorv introduced P4 Verification and will share the paper link in camera-ready version later.
4. Vinay will share the open-source git repo for Mizar (XDP based tool developed by FutureWei)

### Future collaboration opportunities 
We explored following points for collaboration possibilities:
1. The recent NSDI paper (from Futurewei’s team) Arion: Programmable Cloud Data plane platform) provides good opportunity for P4-related collaboration. 
2. eBPF-related observability is useful for MRC team
3. Regarding pre-research about dataplane programming languages of Futurewei’s team. The idea is to have a unified dataplane language for P4, eBPF, DPDK, etc. capable of providing more abstract and complete constructs. One idea was to support fault injection within the dataplane through this language.
