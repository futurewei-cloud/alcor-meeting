1. ML for NCM Planning
    * Algorithm part
        * Actively send down network configuration
            * Automatically send down network configuration when there's a request
        * Semantic merging/semantic checking of network configuration
            * Semantic merging: combine similar requests 
            * Semantic checking: Different types of network configurations are checked to see if there are any contradictions
    * Engineering work
        * Consistency check of network configuration
            * Deployment
                * Information collecting
                * Model reasoning
                * Incremental training
2. Current work update
    * VPC-based implementation for Message Queue scale path (Min Chen/Luyao) 
        * Goal state v2:  need to test the code with Jenkins.  Some logic from VPC as topics still missing
        * ACA code - working on it, made changes on Pulsar version and a couple of files.  
    * Scalability test framework for 1M nodes regions and 100K ports VPC (Jiawei/Min Chen)
        * Functional testing (Fangjin) 
            * Local environment for ACA and control plane has been set up. Waiting for Luyao's work to be completed for ACA and Alcor integration
            * Will begin Jenkins testing
        * Large scale performance testing
            * Function deployment in containerï¼šFunction deployment in container: Was able to created docker pulsar server and client in local environment.  Was able to create and send down a topic, but ran into issue on the server side.  
            * Researching - The topology of the container
            * Action Item: will begin actual testing first


**08/19/2021 Meeting Notes**

* Research Paper Discussion
    * Message Delivery Paper 
    * Zeta - a Scalable and Robust East-West Communication Framework in Large Scale Clouds
    * Andromeda: Performance, Isolation, and Velocity at Scale in Cloud Network Virtualization
