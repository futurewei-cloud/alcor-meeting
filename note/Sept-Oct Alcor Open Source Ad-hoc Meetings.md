##  Network Intelligence Collaboration Meeting Notes

### 9/30/2022
Discussed the required contents of the final report

### 10/3/2022
Based on the final report template, we went through the details of each section. Designed the experiment plan of models.

### 10/7/2022
Checked the contents of final report draft and refined the model architecture and model training parameters.

### 10/10/2022
Discussed the current experiment results and model improvement. Also discussed about some potential future work of this project.

### 10/14/2022
Went through the final report details and identified the revision items, including the mathematical formula of attention network design, input embedding, clustering modeling, and configuration aggregation.

Discussed the results under various thresholds after lowering the learning rate and increasing the training epochs. Found the optimal threshold of the current testing dataset.

Discussed the appropriate way to present the results, including bar charts, line charts, and tables. The results will be presented based on the contents of the working scenario, where the true positive means prediction hit, the false negative means the prediction miss (will trigger on-demand request later), and the false positive means the redundant deployment.
